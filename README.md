## API FOLDER

You can find simple test APIs realized by using Moockoon in this folder: 

```bash
/OpenApi/demo.json
```
Just import them into your app **Moockoon**.

# Some notes:

- In other use cases I would have used a Layout in this particular case there was no need.
- For security reasons, the .env file will be passed on privately.
- For image storage, I implemented Cloudinary.


# Thank you for your attention!
